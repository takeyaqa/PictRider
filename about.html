          <p class="mb-4">
            <em class="font-semibold italic">PictRider</em> is a modern and
            user-friendly combinatorial testing tool that allows you to easily
            generate test cases using pairwise testing techniques directly on
            the web. It requires no installation and runs entirely in the
            browser, enabling QA engineers and software developers to quickly
            and efficiently design effective test cases.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">With PictRider, you can:</p>
          <ul class="mb-4 list-disc pl-8">
            <li>Define test parameters and their possible values</li>
            <li>Create complex constraints between parameters</li>
            <li>
              Generate optimized test cases that cover all pairwise combinations
            </li>
            <li>View and export the generated test cases</li>
            <li>
              And no installation required; get started immediately from your
              browser
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-8">
          <h3 class="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold">What is Pairwise Testing?</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
            <em class="font-semibold italic">Pairwise testing</em> is a
            combinatorial testing technique used to reduce the number of test
            cases while maintaining high test coverage. It is based on the
            principle that most defects are caused by interactions between two
            parameters rather than multiple simultaneous factors.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            In this approach, test cases are generated to cover all possible
            combinations of input values for every pair of parameters. This
            greatly reduces the total number of tests needed compared to
            exhaustive testing, while still ensuring that critical interactions
            are evaluated.
          </p>
          <p>Pairwise testing is especially effective when:</p>
          <ul class="mb-4 list-disc pl-8">
            <li>You need to cover a wide range of parameter combinations</li>
            <li>
              Full combinatorial testing is impractical due to time or resource
              constraints
            </li>
            <li>
              You want to systematically reduce redundant test cases without
              sacrificing coverage quality
            </li>
          </ul>
